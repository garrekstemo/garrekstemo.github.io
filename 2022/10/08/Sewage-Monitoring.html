    <h2>Sewage Monitoring</h2>
    <h6 class="dateline">Saturday, October 08 2022<a class="permalinkanchor" title="Permalink" href="/2022/10/08/Sewage-Monitoring.html">&emsp;⚓︎</a></h6>
    
    <p>I have seen a few articles in the press this year on sewage monitoring for tracking disease and the health of a city. Sara Reardon writing for Scientific American reports on how <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wastewater-monitoring-offers-powerful-tool-for-tracking-covid-and-other-diseases/?amp=true">wastewater monitoring has been taken up as a tool by the CDC</a> and local communities for tracking COVID and other diseases in the US. The impact of wastewater data aggregation and analysis could be huge — in both the positive and negative. It strikes me that governments are largely reactionary to changes in public health. Little attention is paid to preventative measures. This could change that.</p>

<p>Thinking more broadly, I think this tool has much greater potential than disease tracking. Combining wastewater data with other inputs could be a monumental shift in understanding the health of a community on quite a granular level — both in terms of what substances are circulating in a community and the potential for real-time fidelity. You can imagine wastewater data being combined with data from hospitals, air quality monitoring, or even news of major events affecting the mental health of a city.</p>

<p>A recent article in The Economist gives a broad perspective <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/07/how-covid-19-spurred-governments-to-snoop-on-sewage">on wastewater monitoring and how it is being used globally</a>, including the benefits and potential dangers of sewage data collection.</p>
