<p>
Iâ€™m a molecular/chemical physicist at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan 
in the <a href="https://qps-lab-naist-en.labby.jp">Quantum Photo-Science Laboratory</a>
researching interactions between molecules and confined light at femtosecond and picosecond time scales with ultrafast lasers.
</p>
<p>
I am also interested in how governments allocate resources to scientific output.
Funding basic research has a track record of improving quality of life and driving economic growth,
yet governments around the world have been cutting science budgets.
For a myriad of reasons, funding basic science has to increase.

This website is my home on the internet, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24087834/hank-green-decoder-podcast-google-youtube-web-media-platforms-distribution-future">websites are back!</a>
(now that the internet as we know it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results">is broken</a>
and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results">social media</a> is... not really what we wanted it to be, is it?)
