## Light-matter strong coupling

When matter interacts with a quantized electromagnetic field under
certain conditions, the result is a hybrid quasi-particle called a
“polariton”. I study a particular type of polariton called a
“vibrational polariton”. These result from strongly coupled molecular
vibrations and quantized light. Light is quantized by confining the
electromagnetic wave between two highly reflective mirrors. In my
research, the mirrors are about 10 to 20 micrometers apart.

	<figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> Molecules can couple to a confined electromagnetic field
	simply by placing them between two highly reflective mirrors.
	The cavity field and molecular vibrations exchange energy. If the
	rate of this exchange is faster than molecular dissipative processes
	or photon leakage out of the cavity, then the
	system is said to be strongly coupled. The system can then be examined using
	ultrafast pump and probe laser pulses.

One of the most exciting things about vibrational polaritons is that
they can be used to modify chemical reactions. We’re not sure about the
details of how this happens, so that’s a major area of focus for the
field. [This article on quantum
control](https://www.chemistryworld.com/holy-grails/the-grails/quantum-
control) goes into a bit more detail.

	<figcaption><b>Figure 2.</b> The energy curve on the left shows the discrete
	molecular vibrational energy levels. When a transition between
	two levels has the same energy as a cavity photon (on the right),
	then the two can couple to form a new system with different energy 
	eigenstates, called the upper and lower polariton. The energy that
	separates these eigenstates is called the Rabi splitting energy. This 
	represents the rate of energy exchange between the molecules and the
	quantized electromagnetic field.

### Interests

I’m interested in the physics of vibrational polaritons and how they
facilitate modified chemical reactivity. Ultrafast laser spectroscopy is
the tool for this job. It allows me to study how the molecule-light
interaction changes over extremely short time scales (picoseconds).
There is still a lot to uncover about these curious quasi-particles. We
don’t have a full picture of how vibrational polaritons relax from
excited states, for example. The role of polariton coherence, population
transfer, and interactions with the reservoir excitations (uncoupled
molecules) also need to be studied further to understand how all of
these factors might play into modified reactivity.
