    <h2>The New York Times Makes a Podcast-like App</h2>
    <h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, May 23 2023<a class="permalinkanchor" title="Permalink" href="/2023/05/23/The-New-York-Times-Makes-a-Podcast-like-App.html">&emsp;⚓︎</a></h6>
    
    <p>The New York Times just released New York Times Audio, an app for “audio journalism”. It curates all of the New York Times podcasts (including a new daily podcast called “Headlines”) as well as podcasts from third parties, like Foreign Policy and This American Life. It will also include audio versions of written articles.</p>

<p>I think it will be difficult to penetrate the pretty well established spoken-word market. Podcasts are dominated by Apple Podcasts, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688644/spotify-podcast-gimlet-rogan-audiobook-pew">Spotify has had a hard time</a> turning podcasting into a core part of its business. I can see NYT Audio being a niche product that appeals to a small subset of NYT subscribers, but not much more. I’m guessing the goal is to charge a fee for third parties to access NYT subscribers. I don’t really see how this app would generate more revenue from existing subscribers both because I don’t see huge numbers using the app and because podcasts are traditionally free and use open web standards. Again, see Spotify’s and other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433143/castbox-private-rss-feeds-tags-patreon">attempts to make proprietary podcasting formats</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try the app, but I don’t see it becoming a habit. <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> is already on my Home Screen and adding another podcast app is a tall order. If I find something I like, I will most likely just add it to a playlist in Overcast.</p>
