These are just a couple of highlights of my work in Julia.

<h3><a href="https://garrek.org/TransferMatrix.jl">TransferMatrix.jl</a></h3>

A general 4 &times; 4 transfer matrix implementation for Julia built for reusability, ease-of-use, shareability based on some of the latest peer-reviewed research on the topic with full documentation and extensive tutorials.


<h3><a href="https://github.com/garrekstemo/InteractivePlotExamples.jl">Interactive Plots in GLMakie</a></h3>

I can't say enough good things about the Makie plotting software.
One of the backends uses the GPU to render plots, which makes it responsive and interactive.
This is a collection of examples of how to make interactive plots in Makie demonstrating some basic physics concepts.
If you have ideas for more examples, open an issue or a pull request.


<h3><a href="https://github.com/garrekstemo/Intro-to-Julia-for-spectroscopy">Introduction to Julia for Spectroscopy</a></h3>

I've been developing basic lectures notes on data analysis in Julia over the years and it's sort of becoming a mini textbook on Julia, intended to be used before a few optics tutorials.
But it's now mostly a basic introduction to Julia with a couple of examples from spectroscopy.


<h3>This website!</h3>

I wanted a (almost) completely hand-coded website using just HTML and CSS.
The layout, colors, styling, and fonts are all chosen / designed by me.
I use Eleventy to make it easier to manage and deploy, and I host on GitHub Pages.
