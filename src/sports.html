I do a couple of sports now, although I never really thought myself an athlete before.
I guess I probably could at this point.
This page is a selection of accomplishments.

<h3>Kettlebell Sport</h3>
This is a cool and niche sport I started competing in seriously in 2025.
Here's the <a href="https://www.kettlebellworld.org/ranking-tables-competition-rules">ranking table</a> for the International Kettlebell Organization (IKO).
I'm currently <a href="https://www.kettlebellworld.org/iko-ranked-athletes">Sport Rank 2</a> in the 10 min biathlon with 2 &times; 16 kg kettlebells.


<table class="running-table">
    <tr>
      <th>January 10, 2026</th>
      <td>Agatsu OG Winter Classic, Ottawa</td>
      <td>Biathlon, 2 &times; 16 kg</td>
      <td>153 pts (67J / 172S)</td>
      <td>Rank 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>April 5, 2025</th>

      <td>71 reps</td>
      <td>Rank 1</td>
    </tr>

<h3>Running</h3>
Times are net because I'm not a pro.
