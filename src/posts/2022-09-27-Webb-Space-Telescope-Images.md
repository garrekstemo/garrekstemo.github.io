The modern news cycle is a periodic deluge. I don't get the sense that the James Webb Space Telescope launch has hit the public in the same way that the Hubble did. It seems like everyone moved on pretty quickly. I can't help but keep going back to the Webb images and looking at them in awe, with a much better viewing experience on modern computer displays unavailable to those seeing the Hubble images for the first time.
