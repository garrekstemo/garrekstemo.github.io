Zeynep Tufekci, in an op-ed for the New York Times, ponders the implications of generative AI as we very likely enter the dawn of a new technological era.

> Teachers could assign a complicated topic and allow students to use such tools as part of their research. Assessing the veracity and reliability of these A.I.-generated notes and using them to create an essay would be done in the classroom, with guidance and instruction from teachers. The goal would be to increase the quality and the complexity of the argument.

> This would require more teachers to provide detailed feedback. Unless sufficient resources are provided equitably, adapting to conversational A.I. in flipped classrooms could exacerbate inequalities.

> In schools with fewer resources, some students may end up turning in A.I.-produced essays without obtaining useful skills or really knowing what they have written. 

I 100% agree. The coming sophisticated AI will demand that schools use more labor-intensive teaching methods.
She is also right that this will exacerbate inequalities unless we as a society put a lot more money into our education systems.
