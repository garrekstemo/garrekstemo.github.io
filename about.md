## About

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at the [Nara Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.naist.jp/en) in Japan at the [Quantum Materials Science Laboratory](https://mswebs.naist.jp/LABs/optics/) researching light-matter interactions with lasers. I use a femtosecond pulse laser to study these interactions at very short time scales. I spend a lot of time at the optics table, but I also write my own analysis workflows in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

As a PhD candidate I mentor new students, which is fun because it forces me to finally learn physics vocabulary in Japanese (English is not the first language in my lab).

I use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) and Julia's [Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) plotting package to make the figures on this site.
