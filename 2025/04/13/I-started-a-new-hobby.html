    <h2>I started a new hobby</h2>
    <h6 class="dateline">Sunday, April 13 2025<a class="permalinkanchor" title="Permalink" href="/2025/04/13/I-started-a-new-hobby.html">&emsp;⚓︎</a></h6>
    
    <p>I started photography.</p>

<p>This is the hobby I told myself never to get into specifically because I knew that I would get really into it.
It combines all elements of a good hobby: gadgets, science, and creativity.
It gets you outside.
The problem is the cost.
It seemed too easy to spend a lot.</p>

<p>Some time last year I discovered that the iPhone has a feature where the lock screen can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23461505/iphone-ios-16-lock-screen-photo-shuffle-nature-quick-tip-how-to">rotate through photos</a> from your library based on categories.
I picked nature.
After several months, I noticed that there were certain photos I liked a lot more than others.
They were all taken with real cameras, not a smartphone.
Like an old DSLR or an old Sony point-and-shoot I had ten years ago.
I still liked those photos more than the ones taken on whatever latest iPhone I was carrying around.</p>

<p>So now I have a camera.
The Nikon Z 5 with the 24-200 mm zoom lens.
I specifically did not want the best camera, and the lens seems pretty good.
It’s be better than anything I’ve ever used, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Anyway, take a look.
There’s a new Photography item in the left menu that takes you to a gallery.</p>

<p>Oh and I decided to make a Sports section too.
We’ll see how long that lasts.</p>
