Sewage monitoring is low-level persistent in the news.
Former members of [President Biden's Covid-19 advisory board](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/opinion/covid-pandemic-failures.html) write in the New York Times

> the national reporting system for collecting and testing samples from wastewater treatment systems for Covid remains limited, uncoordinated and insufficiently standardized for a robust national surveillance system. If public health officials can’t track the data to mobilize a response to a crisis, the information that has been collected doesn’t do much good.

I had thought a program like this would have made it into the recently-passed infrastructure package. It would be a shame if health and safety monitoring systems (like wildfire or region-wide earthquake monitoring) were not built or strengthened in the near future.

Here's more details on sewage on Jim Al-Khalili's excellent BBC podcast, The Life Scientific:
