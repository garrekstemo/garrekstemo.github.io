The New York Times just released New York Times Audio, an app for “audio journalism”. It curates all of the New York Times podcasts (including a new daily podcast called “Headlines”) as well as podcasts from third parties, like Foreign Policy and This American Life. It will also include audio versions of written articles.

I think it will be difficult to penetrate the pretty well established spoken-word market. Podcasts are dominated by Apple Podcasts, and [Spotify has had a hard time](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23688644/spotify-podcast-gimlet-rogan-audiobook-pew) turning podcasting into a core part of its business. I can see NYT Audio being a niche product that appeals to a small subset of NYT subscribers, but not much more. I’m guessing the goal is to charge a fee for third parties to access NYT subscribers. I don’t really see how this app would generate more revenue from existing subscribers both because I don’t see huge numbers using the app and because podcasts are traditionally free and use open web standards. Again, see Spotify’s and other [attempts to make proprietary podcasting formats](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433143/castbox-private-rss-feeds-tags-patreon).

I’ll try the app, but I don’t see it becoming a habit. [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) is already on my Home Screen and adding another podcast app is a tall order. If I find something I like, I will most likely just add it to a playlist in Overcast.
