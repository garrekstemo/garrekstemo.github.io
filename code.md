## Code

### [TransferMatrix.jl](https://garrek.org/TransferMatrix.jl)

A general 4 &times; 4 transfer matrix implementation for Julia built for reusability, ease-of-use, shareability based on some of the latest peer-reviewed research on the topic with full documentation and extensive tutorials.


### [Interactive Plots in GLMakie](https://github.com/garrekstemo/InteractivePlotExamples.jl)

I can't say enough how much I'm in love with the Makie plotting software. One of the backends uses the GPU to render plots, which makes it responsive and interactive. This is a collection of examples of how to make interactive plots in Makie demonstrating some basic physics concepts. If you have ideas for more examples, open an issue or a pull request.


### Other Projects

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/garrekstemo) page for other projects I'm working on.

I also want to give a shout-out to [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/). This is the workhorse of my research and the best plotting software I've *ever* used. The plots that it generates look good out of the box, and its GPU-powered and interactive features let me do modeling and data exploration easily. I try to push the boundaries of the interactive features of Makie and occasionally post about any rough edges and any cool things that I find on the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org).
